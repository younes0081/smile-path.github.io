         <h3 class="article__view-subtitle">By Ross</h3>
         <p class="article__view-content">Unlike any other city in the world, Istanbul is literally split between two continents. This magical city where east meets west is packed full of minarets, amazing attractions, and a cultural diversity more exciting and deep than most.  The strategic location of the city and its situation at the heart of the Silk Road, has made it a prize for many over the centuries and the city has been influenced by many an ancient civilisation such as the Greeks, the Romans, the Venetians and the Ottomans. Today that influence is still clear to see and the variation of architecture in the city is awe-inspiring. The city offers an equally vibrant and diverse culinary scene too, whether its aromatic Asian dishes, Mediterranean classics or a delicious local Kebab, the city will inspire your taste buds too. Istanbul has become a firm favourite amongst The Luxury Editor team and so we felt it only fair to share some of our favourite luxury hotels in this buzzing, wondrous city.</p>
